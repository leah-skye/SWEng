# Course project: Beta Release

## Overview

Make progress on the implementation of your project and solidify the
documentation for end-users and developers.

## Set up

Work with your project group to (1) make progress towards the final release, (2)
provide a comprehensive user documentation, and (3) provide a comprehensive
developer documentation.

## Instructions

### 1. Make progress in your public GitHub repository (40%)

  - Each group member must contribute to the code base.
  - Each group member must demonstrate proper use of version control and CI.
  - Each contribution (commit/pull request) must be tested, and commented.
  - Complete this in the **main branch** of your repository by due date. *(Check Calendar!)*


### 2. Write user documentation (30%)

Your public repository must contain a complete user manual. Anyone looking at
your repository should be able to easily find the user manual. **The user
manual is focused solely on people who want to use your project**.

The user manual should describe the functionality of your project as you expect
it to be at the end of the quarter. For this assignment, **indicate missing
functionality as work in progress**.

The user documentation should include at least the following information:

  - **A high-level description.** What does the system do and why would a user
    want to use it.

  - **How to install the software.** If your system has prerequisites
    (e.g., tools, libraries, emulators, third-party applications, etc.),
    your instructions should list all of them and indicate how to
    install and configure them. Make sure to indicate what specific version
    requirements these prerequisites must satisfy.
    If running the system requires the installation of, e.g., a virtual machine,
    a database, or an emulator, make sure to provide clear step-by-step
    instructions.

  - **How to run the software.** How to start up the system?
    
  - **How to use the software.** You can assume that your user is familiar with
    your particular platform (e.g., use of a Web browser, desktop applications,
    or mobile applications). For missing functionality, your documentation
    should simply indicate that this functionality is work in progress.

  - **How to report a bug.** This should include not just the mechanics (a
    pointer to your issue tracker), but also what information is needed.
    You can set up a bug-report template in your issue tracker, or you can
    reference a resource about how to write a good bug report. Here is an
    [example for bug reporting guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Bug_writing_guidelines).

  - **Known bugs.** Known bugs or limitations should be documented in the bug tracker.
    A user testing the implemented use case(s) should not encounter trivial bugs
    (e.g., NPEs) or a large number of bugs that are unlisted in your bug tracker.

Complete this in the **main branch** of your repository by due date. *(Check Calendar!)*


### 3. Developer documentation (30%)

Your public repository must contain developer guidelines. Anyone looking at
your repository should be able to easily find these guidelines. **The developer
guidelines are focused solely on people who want to contribute to your project**.

The developer documentation should include at least the following information:

  - **How to obtain the source code.** If your system uses multiple repositories
    or submodules, provide clear instructions for how to obtain all relevant
    sources.

  - **The layout of your directory structure.** What do the various directories
    (folders) contain, and where to find source files, tests, documentation,
    data files, etc.

  - **How to build the software.** Provide clear instructions for how to use
    your project's build system to build all system components.

  - **How to test the software.** Provide clear instructions for how to run the
    system's test cases. In some cases, the instructions may need to include
    information such as how to access data sources or how to interact with
    external systems. You may reference the user documentation (e.g.,
    prerequisites) to avoid duplication.

  - **How to add new tests.** Are there any naming conventions/patterns to
    follow when naming test files? Is there a particular test harness to use?

  - **How to build a release of the software.** Describe any tasks that are not
    automated. For example, should a developer update a version number (in code
    and documentation) prior to invoking the build system? Are there any sanity
    checks a developer should perform after building a release?

Complete this in the **main branch** of your repository by due date. *(Check Calendar!)*


### 4. Submit to Canvas

When you finish all the tasks above, copy the GitHub link to the last related commit to Canvas.
[This page](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits) describes how to "navigate to a specific commit."

Make sure this commit is inside the due date timeline! *(Check Calendar)*


## Clarifications

### What if info needed in my user or developer documentation already exists in my living document?

The documentation in your repository should be largely self-contained, and anyone
looking for documentation should find it, or a link to it, in the repository.

You may link to sections of your living document from your user/developer
documentation, or you may move these sections to the repository and put a link
to it in your living document.

**Do not maintain two parallel versions of any documentation.**


### What if my last commit also has stuff not related to this release?

  - If the commit HAS something relate to it, fine. We just want a checkpoint for when the team finished this task.
  - If the commit DOES NOT HAVE something related to it, look through the commits history and find the last one that has.
  - The most important part here is that the commit is inside the deadline time.
